Pelican-sober is a very light theme focused on readability :

* Integration of [TinyTypo](http://tinytypo.tetue.net)
* Utilisation of the font Source Sans Pro
* Option to fade out sidebar to focus on article reading

This theme provides classical features like Google & Piwik Analytics, Twitter, Disqus and Pygments integration.
